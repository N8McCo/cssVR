HI, I heard you want to do cool VR stuff on the Web using CSS and HTML. You came to the right place. Let's get you started:

1. Make sure one of the [Firefox VR enabled builds](http://vrhelloworld.com/builds/ "VR Firefox") installed
2. Make sure you have installed yeoman `npm install -g yo`
3. Install the VR CSS generator `npm install -g generator-vrcss`
4. Type `yo vrcss YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` to create an hello world VR experience in the YOUR_PROJECT_NAME folder
5. Open YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/index.html in your VR Browser
6. If you press 'f' the browser should go fullscreen and the content rendered in stereo mode.

If you don't like yeoman you can also copy the template manually:

1. Clone this repo
`git clone https://github.com/dmarcos/cssVR.git`
3. Copy the template folder to wherever you want
`cp -rf template YOUR_VR_EXPERIENCE_PATH`
