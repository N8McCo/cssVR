HI, I heard you want to do cool VR stuff on the Web using CSS and HTML. You came to the right place. Let's get you started

1. Clone this repo
`git clone https://github.com/dmarcos/cssVR.git`

2. Make sure you have one of the [VR enabled builds](http://vrhelloworld.com/builds/ "VR Firefox") installed
3. Copy the template folder to wherever you want
`cp -rf template YOUR_VR_EXPERIENCE_PATH`
4. Open index.html in your VR Browser
5. If you press 'f' the browser should go fullscreen and the content rendered in stereo.
